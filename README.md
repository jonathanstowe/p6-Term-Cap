# Term::Cap
Interface to the terminal capability database for Perl 6.

## Description

This is a re-implementation of the Perl 5 module Term::Cap for Perl 6.

It provides access to the terminal capabilities database for Unix like systems,
providing a usable set of defaults for platforms where there is no termcap or
terminfo available.

You may be better off using a higher level abstraction such as curses.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working Rakudo Perl 6 installation you should be able to
install this with *zef* :

    zef install Term::Cap

## Support

Suggestions/patches are
welcomed via github at:

https://github.com/jonathanstowe/p6-Term-Cap/issues

I'm not able to test on a wide variety of platforms so any help there
would be appreciated.

## Licence

Please see the LICENCE file in the distribution directory
